# Objective
This is a data science project in which I have built a model for real estate price prediction. I have used bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com and used linear regression model for prediction. During model building I have done all these steps such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 

# Technology and tools used:
Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
