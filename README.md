# Objective
This project focuses on building a Real Estate Price Prediction model for Bangalore city using machine learning techniques. Using Linear Regression as the primary model, it predicts the prices of homes based on various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle.
# Project Overview
1.Built a machine learning model using Linear Regression.

Conducted extensive data preprocessing including:

Data cleaning

Outlier detection and removal

Feature engineering

Dimensionality reduction

2.Performed model selection and evaluation:

Achieved a cross-validated R² score of 0.82 using Linear Regression.

Compared against Lasso Regression (R² = 0.69) and Decision Tree Regressor (R² = 0.72).

3.Implemented hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and ShuffleSplit cross-validation for optimal model performance.

# Technologies Used
Python

Libraries:

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

Tools:

Jupyter Notebook

Visual Studio Code

# Workflow
1.Dataset Acquisition:
Downloaded the Bangalore home price dataset from Kaggle.

2.Data Preprocessing:

Removed irrelevant features

Handled missing values

Detected and removed outliers

Created new meaningful features

Reduced dimensionality to avoid overfitting

3.Model Training and Evaluation:

Split data into training and testing sets.

Trained models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor.

Applied GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

Used ShuffleSplit for robust cross-validation.

Selected the best-performing model based on R² scores.

4.Result:

Linear Regression achieved the best R² score of 0.82, outperforming other models.

# How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-prediction.git
cd real-estate-price-prediction

2.Install the required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

3.Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb

# Results and Insights
1.Linear Regression proved highly effective for this dataset due to the linear relationship between features and the target.

2.Feature engineering (especially handling "total_sqft" and "location") significantly improved model accuracy.

3.Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was crucial in maximizing the model's performance.
